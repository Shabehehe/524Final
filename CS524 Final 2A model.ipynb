    "To optimize and find the best team, while staying within a certain amount of money, we utilize a linear program with binomial array variables, with the variables representing a player catagory or player position. Each element represents a certain player in each of the variables. They are ordered coresponding to the file DKSalaries2.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first constraint, $\\Sigma$ players[i] for i in 2:numPlayers <= 8, is that the number of players, the sum of all elements in variable players, that we need to a team cannot be greater than 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second block of constraint: For all of the variable arrays other than the variable players, a element is labeled with a 0 or 1 if they are considered by the data to be in that category or position, and a 0 if they are not. Note that all players are also utility players (UTIL), which basically is a flexible, nonconstrainted position to the team of eight that we are trying to optimize. In addition, all power and short guards are also considered the position guards, and \n",
    "all power and short forwards are also considered the position forward.\n",

    "The third constraint, $\\Sigma$ (players[i] * playerList[i,6]) for i in 2:numPlayers <= 50000, is that the sum of the salaries for each of the eight players chosen cannot be over the salary budget, $50,000. \n",

    "\n",
    "The fifth block of constraints is that for each position, there cannot be more than one player at each selected position to be chosen. Even though there are overlaps for each player in what position they play, the model is deisigned so that a player from each position will be chosen. \n",
