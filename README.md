# 524Final
If you look at the DKSalaries2.csv that is the player information.  
You can have one of each of the following positions: PG,SG,SF,PF,C,G,F,C,UTIL.  
You can't spend more than $50,000  
And one catch is that players can be listed under many positions. For example all players are in the UTIL category and all of the PG and SG players are also in the G category.  
I originally was going to read in each position as their own csv file but ran into problems with my model wanting the same player to be in multiple positions.  
Let me know if you have any questions or it doesn't work for you.
