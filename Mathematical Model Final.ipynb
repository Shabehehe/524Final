I know it wasn't as optimal as the new method found, but I wasn't confident on the specifics enough to discuss why. It shouldn't be that much to add it in at the end.

    "\n",
    "All the models are based on typical fantasy basketball team websites like DraftKings so most of the assumptions made in the following models are directly from DraftKings or the NBA. For starters, an optimal lineup is always going to consist of one small forward, one small guard, one power forward, one power guard, one center, one flexible guard, one flexible forward, and an utilty player, for a total of eight players. NBA team rosters usually have a lot more than 8 players on a team so that teams are not stressed out, but to make things easier for fantasy owners, DraftKings just keeps the roster lineup size to eight players. For the purpose of our project, we obtained a roster of 92 players that were scheduled to play that day, April 19th, from DraftKings, namely the csv file DKSalaries2.csv. Inside that file also contains data such as the defined positions that they can play at, the amount to draft specific players, and the average number of fantasy points scored per game. Note that the salary for each player, as well as fantasy points that a player scores is determined by how well they play during a game. Factors considered include statistics like rebounds, points scored, assists, steals, blocks, minutes played, and more. Of course, the better the player does when playing games, the better statistics they have, and the more valuable they are, corresponding to an higher salary and average fantasy points scored.\n",
